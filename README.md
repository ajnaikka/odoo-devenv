Unfortunately odoo v10 doesn't work with this condiguration, as odoo v10 docker images doesn't contains python3 on it. I have tries multi-stage docker build too for installing python3 in v10 dockerimage, but in vain.

I you have any solution to this problem or any ideas feel free to reach me on ajnaikkavignesh2707@gmail.com or on linkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/vignesh2707/
